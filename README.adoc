uC++ Development Environment
============================

A docker container that can be used to build and run uC\++ code. This container
is intended for users who would like to compile uC++ locally and do not use
a supported platform for their programming assignments.

== Prerequisites
* Install docker (via the https://docker.com[official website] or through your
package manager)
* Be willing to learn a little docker

== Installing
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection.

. clone this repo locally
. `cd uCPP-dev-container`
. `make`

== Running
.Ordered
. run the `u++-shell.sh` script from the directory where your uC++ code is
. compile and run your programs from this shell (see docker docs for more
complex usage)
. `exit` when you are done, *THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA IN THE CONTAINER OUTSIDE
OF THE DIRECTORY WHERE YOU RAN `u++shell.sh`, DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU LOSE YOUR
WORK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*
